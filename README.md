## 🎯 Approach

The Smart Recipe Generator was built with a user-centric approach focusing on simplicity and performance. The frontend uses vanilla JavaScript for fast loading and smooth interactions, with a responsive design that works across all devices. The backend employs a RESTful API architecture with Express.js, providing efficient recipe matching algorithms.

Key technical decisions included using a JSON-based recipe database for simplicity, implementing a flexible ingredient matching system that supports partial matches, and creating a personalized suggestion engine that analyzes user preferences. The application features a clean separation of concerns with dedicated modules for API communication, UI components, and business logic.

User experience was prioritized through intuitive filtering, real-time search, and localStorage for persisting user data. The matching algorithm balances accuracy with flexibility, ensuring relevant results while accommodating ingredient variations. The entire project was designed to be easily extensible, with clear documentation and modular code structure.

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. **Backend**: `cd backend && npm install && npm start`
2. **Frontend**: `cd frontend && npx live-server --port=3000`
3. **Access**: Open `http://localhost:3000`
